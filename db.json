For example, you can set a condition to add new<br/>Amazon EC2 instances in increments to the Auto Scaling group when the average utilization of your Amazon EC2 fileet is high; and similarly, you can set a condition to remove instances in the same increments when CPU utilization is low. If you have predictable load changes, you can set a schedule through Auto Scaling to plan your scaling actMties. You can use Amazon CIoudWatch to send alarms to trigger scaling actMties and Elastic Load Balancing to help distribute traffic to your instances within Auto Scaling groups.

Common reasons for deploying a Read Replica include:<br/>Scaling beyond the compute or I/O capacity of a single DB Instance for read-heavy database workloads.
